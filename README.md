## Overview
### Description
Yelp style app designed to specifically rate the food in MHC's Blanchard Hall. It would show the ratings for the food available on a certain day. 

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social / Food ratings 
- **Mobile:** This app is limited to only mobiles due to the convenience of uploading pictures. 
- **Story:** Analyzes daily meals at the dining hall and then would give a rating out of 5 stars. Students at MHC would have the ability to upload their food combinations and their specific ratings, as this app is collaborative.
- **Market:** The market would primarily be Mount Holyoke students, although Mount Holyoke faculty and staff might also find it useful. 
- **Habit:** The average user would use the app 1-4 times a day. The user has the opportunity to solely use the app or to publish reviews and add pictures of the food.
- **Scope:** The app would not be particularly challenging to build. This app gives us the freedom to only include the food in Blanchard Hall, or to expand the structure to all of the Five Colleges.
